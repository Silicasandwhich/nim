A fork of [evobot](https://github.com/eritislami/evobot) with added features for sending messages. Requires admin privileges to work, so its use is not recommended if you do not know what you are doing.

# Added Features
* **DM Logging:** Log all DMs sent to nim (change user to send log to in `.config`.
* `/say`: Have nim send a message in a channel of your choice
* `/whisper`: Have nim send a DM to a user of the server
* `/react`: Make nim react to a message
* `/unreact`: Remove nim's reaction from a message
* `'/nap`: Have nim send the attachment from the URL located in `/commands/took-a-nap.js`, line 17.

# Exigence and Inspiration
Nim was originally used as a music bot for my online Dungeons and Dragons game, a heavily modified version of *Waterdeep: Dragon Heist.* This bot was named after a party-favorite character from that module, who is an eccentric, inventive robot named nim (and is also, ironically, mute). Though that game is now finished, I feel this bot will find its uses yet in future projects.

# Contributing
This is not meant to be a project for use by the general public, so I make no promises of its usability, utility, or functionality. Furthermore, do not expect issues or pull requests to be resolved. I have left the source open for the sake of my friends who may have use for a music bot with the features I have added.
